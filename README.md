Knapsack sorting project , in C#

-->Welcome to the ReadMe for the knapsack console program

--> Name of the Application knapsack-text-file-project-cSharp

--> Version: • Version 1.0

--> Description The application's main goal is to find a packaging solution. A package weight cap and a list of items with their individual indices, weights, and prices are provided to the application. The objective is to choose the package contents that maximize total cost while maintaining a weight that is within the weight restriction.

To accomplish this goal, the application must assess all feasible item combinations and choose the one that maximizes total cost while satisfying the weight restriction. When there are multiple combinations with the same total cost, the application should take into account that it is preferable to send a package with a lower weight.

The constraints for the application are as follows:

The maximum weight that a package can take is 100.
There can be up to 15 items to choose from.
The maximum weight and cost of an item are both 100.
